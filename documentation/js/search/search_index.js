If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n3.4.

This   *\nlimitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *\npersonal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *\nextent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *\nincidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *\nlimitation may not apply to You.                                    *\n                                                                 *\n\n\n\nLitigation\n\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\nVersions of the License\n\n\n10.1.
